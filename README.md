## Same element reference

- if we pass a child component as children of parent component then “Unnecessary renders can be avioided.

- In React, when a parent component renders, React will recursively render all of its child
  components.

- “Unnecessary renders” where the child component goes through the render phase but not the
  commit phase.

- You can extract the expensive child component and instead pass it down as props to the parent
  component.

- Whenever there is a re-render caused by a change in the state of the parent component, React
  will optimize the re-render for you by knowing that the props has to be referencing the same
  element before and after the render.
